              engines and Deep learning.
              <br /> The Application is designed for educational and evaluation

              This Application is the brainchild of Pasindu Akalpa, a brilliant
              student of Informatics Institute of Sri Lanka, who created it as
              his final year project in 2023 - 2024. The goal of this
              Application is to show off the power of Vector Database and Deep
              learning in making desktop search engines super awesome.
              <br /> The Application is meant for learning and testing only, so
              don't blame us if it breaks your computer or deletes your files.
              Just kidding, it won't do that. Probably ðŸ¤ž.
